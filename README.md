# ML_UNI

Welcome to our Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) where we explore and learn about different aspects of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including general ML and AI concepts, data visualization, data preprocessing, normalization, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Autoencoders, and time series analysis.

The repository contains Jupyter Notebook files, each notebook provides clear instructions, explanations, and code snippets to help you grasp the underlying concepts. Additionally, relevant datasets and resources are referenced within the notebooks.

## Usage
To use the notebooks, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
- Set up your Python environment and install the necessary dependencies as mentioned above.
- Launch Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the location where you cloned or downloaded this repository.
- Open the desired notebook (e.g., `lab1.ipynb`) by clicking on it.
- Run the code cells sequentially to execute the code and observe the outputs.
- Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different techniques, and adapt it to your own projects.
